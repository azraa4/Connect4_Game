# Connect4_Game
The goal of this project is to design and implement a Java Connect 4 game, where computer plays against a human.
Connect 4 is a two-player strategy board game that is played on a vertical grid with 7 columns and 6 rows. 
Each player takes turns dropping colored coins, usually red and yellow, from the top of the grid into one of the columns.
The coins will fall to the lowest available slot in the column, filling the grid from bottom up. 
The objective of the game is to connect four of your own colored coins in a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal line, while also trying to block your opponent from making their own line.
